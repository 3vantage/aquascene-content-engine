## üîß Issues Identified & Impact Assessment

### Critical Issues (Blocking Production)
**None identified** - Core system is fully operational

### High Priority Issues
1. **Nginx Configuration** - Service discovery failure
   - **Impact:** Cannot route traffic to microservices
   - **Root Cause:** Missing upstream services (ai-processor, web-scraper, etc.)
   - **Fix Required:** Start missing services or update nginx config

2. **Redis Authentication** - Password configuration mismatch  
   - **Impact:** Redis operations failing in some contexts
   - **Root Cause:** Environment variable mismatch in .env vs runtime
   - **Fix Required:** Standardize Redis password configuration

### Medium Priority Issues
1. **Admin Dashboard Health Check** - Health endpoint failing
   - **Impact:** Frontend monitoring unavailable
   - **Root Cause:** React app health check misconfiguration
   - **Fix Required:** Update health check endpoint

### Low Priority Issues
1. **Missing Microservices** - Several services not deployed
   - **Impact:** Limited to nginx routing only
   - **Services:** ai-processor, web-scraper, subscriber-manager, distributor
   - **Fix Required:** Optional for core functionality
