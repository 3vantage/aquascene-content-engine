        'impressions', 'reach', 'engagement', 'saves', 'profile_visits'
    ])
    
    # Calculate performance scores
    engagement_rate = (metrics['engagement'] / metrics['reach']) * 100
    save_rate = (metrics['saves'] / metrics['impressions']) * 100
    
    # Identify high-performing elements
    if engagement_rate > 5.0:
        high_performing_hashtags = extract_hashtags(post_id)
        successful_content_type = classify_content_type(post_id)
        optimal_posting_time = get_posting_time(post_id)
        
        # Store for future optimization
        update_hashtag_performance(high_performing_hashtags, engagement_rate)
        update_content_type_performance(successful_content_type, engagement_rate)
        update_timing_performance(optimal_posting_time, engagement_rate)
    
    return {
        'engagement_rate': engagement_rate,
        'save_rate': save_rate,

        ],
        "fieldConfig": {
          "min": 0,
          "max": 10,
          "thresholds": {
            "steps": [
              {"color": "red", "value": 0},

          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Step 3: Set Up Alerting Rules**

**Prometheus Alert Rules:**
```yaml
# /prometheus/rules/aquascene.yml
groups:
  - name: aquascene_alerts
    rules:
      - alert: HighAPIResponseTime
        expr: aquascene_api_response_time > 5
        for: 2m
        labels:
          severity: warning
        annotations:
          summary: "API response time is high"
          description: "{{ $labels.endpoint }} has response time of {{ $value }}s"
      
      - alert: LowContentQuality
        expr: avg(aquascene_content_quality_score) < 7.0
        for: 5m
        labels:
          severity: critical
        annotations:
          summary: "Content quality has dropped significantly"
          description: "Average quality score is {{ $value }}, below 7.0 threshold"
      
      - alert: ServiceDown
        expr: up == 0
        for: 1m
        labels:
          severity: critical
        annotations:
          summary: "Service {{ $labels.instance }} is down"
          description: "Service has been down for more than 1 minute"
      
      - alert: HighMemoryUsage
        expr: container_memory_usage_bytes / container_spec_memory_limit_bytes > 0.9
        for: 5m
        labels:
          severity: warning
        annotations:
          summary: "Container {{ $labels.name }} high memory usage"
          description: "Memory usage is {{ $value | humanizePercentage }}"
```

**Step 5: Automated Report Generation**

**Weekly Business Report:**
```python
def generate_weekly_report():
    """Generate automated weekly performance report."""
    
    report_data = {
        'week_start': get_week_start(),
        'content_generated': get_content_count(last_week=True),
        'avg_quality_score': get_avg_quality_score(last_week=True),
        'cost_savings': calculate_cost_savings(last_week=True),
        'top_performing_content': get_top_content(last_week=True, limit=5),
        'system_uptime': get_system_uptime(last_week=True),
        'user_satisfaction': get_satisfaction_score(last_week=True)
    }
    
    # Generate HTML report
    html_report = render_template('weekly_report.html', data=report_data)
    
    # Send to stakeholders
    send_email(
        to=['business-team@aquascene.com'],
        subject=f'AquaScene Weekly Report - Week of {report_data["week_start"]}',
        html_content=html_report
    )
    
    return report_data
```

### Tutorial 6.2: Real-Time Progress Tracking Implementation

**Objective**: Implement comprehensive real-time progress tracking for all operations  
**Time Required**: 30-40 minutes  
**Difficulty**: Intermediate to Advanced  

#### WebSocket Implementation for Real-Time Updates

**Step 1: Understand Current Real-Time Features**

**Existing Real-Time Capabilities:**
```
Current WebSocket Endpoints:
- /api/v1/workflows/ws (Airtable workflow progress)
- /api/v1/ai/ws (Content generation progress)
- /api/v1/batch/ws (Batch processing updates)
- /api/v1/system/ws (System health updates)
```

**Real-Time Data Flow:**
```
Data Flow Process:
1. User initiates operation (content generation, batch processing, etc.)
2. Server creates progress tracking record
3. WebSocket connection established for real-time updates
4. Server sends periodic progress updates via WebSocket
5. Frontend displays real-time progress to user
6. Operation completion triggers final status update
```

**Step 2: Enhance Progress Tracking Granularity**

**Detailed Progress Stages:**
```
Content Generation Progress Stages:
1. Request Validation (5%)
2. AI Provider Selection (10%)
3. Context Preparation (15%)
4. Content Generation (60%)
5. Quality Validation (75%)
6. SEO Optimization (85%)
7. Template Application (95%)
8. Final Review (100%)

Batch Processing Progress Stages:
1. Batch Validation (5%)
2. Job Queue Setup (10%)
3. Individual Job Processing (10-90%)
4. Quality Aggregation (95%)
5. Results Compilation (100%)
```

**Enhanced Progress Messages:**
```javascript
// Example real-time progress updates
const progressUpdates = [
  {
    stage: "validation",
    progress: 5,
    message: "Validating content parameters...",
    timestamp: "2025-08-06T10:15:30Z",
    details: {
      topic_validated: true,
      audience_validated: true,
      keywords_processed: 3
    }
  },
  {
    stage: "generation",
    progress: 45,
    message: "AI generating content structure...",
    timestamp: "2025-08-06T10:15:45Z",
    details: {
      sections_planned: 5,
      words_generated: 342,
      estimated_completion: "2025-08-06T10:16:15Z"
    }
  }
];
```

#### Advanced Progress Visualization

**Step 3: Implement Multi-Level Progress Tracking**

**Progress Hierarchy:**
```
Level 1: Overall Operation Progress (0-100%)
├── Level 2: Stage Progress (e.g., Generation: 60%)
│   ├── Level 3: Sub-task Progress (e.g., Writing Introduction: 80%)
│   └── Level 3: Sub-task Progress (e.g., Writing Conclusion: 20%)
└── Level 2: Validation Progress (15%)
    ├── Level 3: Fact Check (100%)
    └── Level 3: Brand Voice Check (50%)
```

**Progressive Disclosure UI:**
```html
<!-- Progress tracking component -->
<div class="progress-container">
  <!-- Overall progress -->
  <div class="progress-bar-main">
    <div class="progress-fill" style="width: {{overall_progress}}%"></div>
    <span class="progress-text">{{overall_progress}}% Complete</span>
  </div>
  
  <!-- Detailed stage breakdown (collapsible) -->
  <div class="progress-details" v-if="showDetails">
    <div class="stage" v-for="stage in stages">
      <div class="stage-header">
        <span class="stage-name">{{stage.name}}</span>
        <span class="stage-status">{{stage.status}}</span>
      </div>
      <div class="stage-progress">
        <div class="progress-bar-small">
          <div class="progress-fill" style="width: {{stage.progress}}%"></div>
        </div>
        <span class="stage-message">{{stage.current_message}}</span>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  
  <!-- Live log stream -->
  <div class="live-logs" v-if="showLogs">
    <div class="log-entry" v-for="log in recentLogs">
      <span class="log-timestamp">{{log.timestamp}}</span>
      <span class="log-message">{{log.message}}</span>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

**Step 4: Implement Performance Prediction**

**Time Estimation Algorithm:**
```python
def estimate_completion_time(operation_type, current_progress, historical_data):
    """Estimate completion time based on historical performance."""
    
    # Get historical data for similar operations
    similar_operations = historical_data.filter(
        operation_type=operation_type,
        complexity_score=get_complexity_score(current_operation)
    )
    
    if similar_operations:
        # Calculate average time per progress percentage
        avg_time_per_percent = similar_operations.aggregate(
            avg_time=Avg('total_duration')
        )['avg_time'] / 100
        
        # Estimate remaining time
        remaining_progress = 100 - current_progress
        estimated_remaining = remaining_progress * avg_time_per_percent
        
        # Apply confidence interval based on variance
        confidence = calculate_confidence_interval(similar_operations)
        
        return {
            'estimated_completion': datetime.now() + timedelta(seconds=estimated_remaining),
            'confidence_level': confidence,
            'min_time': estimated_remaining * 0.8,
            'max_time': estimated_remaining * 1.2
        }
    
    # Fallback to default estimates
    return get_default_estimates(operation_type)
```

#### Error Handling and Recovery Tracking

**Step 5: Implement Comprehensive Error Tracking**

**Error Classification System:**
```
Error Types:
1. Transient Errors (can retry automatically)
   - API rate limits
   - Temporary network issues
   - Service temporarily unavailable

2. Configuration Errors (user action required)
   - Invalid API keys
   - Incorrect parameters
   - Permission issues

3. Content Errors (regeneration recommended)
   - Quality threshold not met
   - Content inappropriate for audience
   - Fact-check failures

4. System Errors (admin attention required)
   - Database connection failures
   - Memory/resource exhaustion
   - Service crashes
```

**Error Recovery Workflow:**
```python
def handle_operation_error(operation_id, error_type, error_details):
    """Handle errors with appropriate recovery strategies."""
    
    recovery_strategies = {
        'transient': {
            'retry_count': 3,
            'retry_delay': [5, 15, 45],  # exponential backoff
            'auto_retry': True
        },
        'configuration': {
            'retry_count': 0,
            'user_notification': True,
            'suggested_fixes': get_configuration_fixes(error_details)
        },
        'content': {
            'retry_count': 2,
            'parameter_adjustment': True,
            'alternative_provider': True
        },
        'system': {
            'retry_count': 0,
            'admin_alert': True,
            'service_restart': True
        }
    }
    
    strategy = recovery_strategies.get(error_type, recovery_strategies['system'])
    
    # Update progress tracking with error information
    update_progress(operation_id, {
        'status': 'error',
        'error_type': error_type,
        'error_message': error_details['message'],
        'recovery_strategy': strategy,
        'next_action': get_next_action(strategy),
        'user_action_required': strategy.get('user_notification', False)
    })
    
    return strategy
```

**Step 6: User Experience Optimization**

**Progressive Enhancement for Slow Connections:**
```javascript
class ProgressTracker {
    constructor(operationId) {
        this.operationId = operationId;
        this.connectionQuality = 'good'; // good, fair, poor
        this.updateFrequency = this.getOptimalUpdateFrequency();
    }
    
    getOptimalUpdateFrequency() {
        // Adjust update frequency based on connection quality
        switch(this.connectionQuality) {
            case 'good': return 1000; // 1 second
            case 'fair': return 3000; // 3 seconds  
            case 'poor': return 5000; // 5 seconds
            default: return 2000;
        }
    }
    
    handleConnectionQualityChange(quality) {
        this.connectionQuality = quality;
        this.updateFrequency = this.getOptimalUpdateFrequency();
        
        // Adjust UI complexity based on connection
        if (quality === 'poor') {
            this.disableRealTimeLogs();
            this.reduceAnimations();
            this.useTextOnlyProgress();
        }
    }
    
    showFallbackProgress() {
        // Show simplified progress for poor connections
        return {
            stage: this.getCurrentStage(),
            estimated_completion: this.getEstimatedCompletion(),
            can_refresh: true,
            refresh_recommended: this.updateFrequency
        };
    }
}
```

**Offline/Connection Loss Handling:**
```javascript
class OfflineProgressHandler {
    constructor() {
        this.isOffline = false;
        this.pendingOperations = new Map();
        this.lastKnownProgress = new Map();
    }
    
    handleConnectionLoss() {
        this.isOffline = true;
        
        // Store last known progress for all operations
        this.pendingOperations.forEach((operation, id) => {
            this.lastKnownProgress.set(id, operation.currentProgress);
        });
        
        // Show offline indicator
        this.showOfflineMessage();
        
        // Provide estimated completion times based on last known progress
        this.showEstimatedCompletions();
    }
    
    handleReconnection() {
        this.isOffline = false;
        
        // Reconnect WebSocket connections
        this.reconnectAllOperations();
        
        // Sync progress for all pending operations
        this.syncPendingOperations();
        
        // Hide offline indicators
        this.hideOfflineMessage();
    }
}
```
