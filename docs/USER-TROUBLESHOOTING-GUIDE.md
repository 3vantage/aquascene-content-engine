   iostat -x 1
   ```

2. **Database Performance**
   ```bash
   # Check for slow queries
   docker-compose exec postgres psql -U aquascene -d content_engine \
     -c "SELECT query, mean_exec_time, calls FROM pg_stat_statements ORDER BY mean_exec_time DESC LIMIT 10;"
   
   # Check for table bloat
   docker-compose exec postgres psql -U aquascene -d content_engine \
     -c "SELECT schemaname, tablename, n_dead_tup, n_live_tup FROM pg_stat_user_tables ORDER BY n_dead_tup DESC;"
   ```

**Optimization Solutions:**
1. **Database Optimization**
   ```bash
   # Run database maintenance
   docker-compose exec postgres psql -U aquascene -d content_engine \
     -c "VACUUM ANALYZE;"
   
   # Reindex if necessary
   docker-compose exec postgres psql -U aquascene -d content_engine \
     -c "REINDEX DATABASE content_engine;"
   ```

2. **Redis Cache Optimization**
   ```bash
   # Check Redis memory usage
   docker-compose exec redis redis-cli INFO memory
   
   # Clear cache if needed
   docker-compose exec redis redis-cli FLUSHALL
   ```

3. **Container Resource Adjustment**
   ```yaml
   # Increase resources for heavy services
   services:
     ai-processor:
       deploy:
         resources:
           limits:
             memory: 8G
             cpus: '4.0'
   ```

## Business User Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: Dashboard Not Showing Expected Data

#### Symptom: Metrics appear to be zero or outdated
**Quick Checks:**
1. **Verify Data Collection**
   ```
   Dashboard ‚Üí Check "Last Updated" timestamp
   If older than 5 minutes:
   - Refresh the page
   - Check if services are online
   - Contact administrator if problem persists
   ```

2. **Check Service Integration**
   ```
   Go to each service section:
   - AI Processor: Try generating test content
   - Subscriber Manager: Check if subscriber data loads
   - Content Manager: Verify content library shows items
   ```

**Solutions:**
1. **Manual Data Refresh**
   ```
   Most dashboards auto-refresh every 30 seconds
   - Force refresh: Ctrl+F5 (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
   - Check browser console for errors (F12)
   - Clear browser cache if needed
   ```

2. **Contact System Administrator**
   ```
   Provide this information:
   - Which metrics are missing/incorrect
   - When you first noticed the issue
   - Whether other users have the same problem
   - Screenshot of the dashboard
   ```

### Issue 2: Understanding ROI Calculations

#### Symptom: Cost savings numbers seem incorrect
**How to Verify ROI Calculations:**
1. **Manual Calculation Check**
   ```
   Previous Cost per Article: $200
   Current Cost per Article: $0.05
   Cost Reduction: (200 - 0.05) / 200 = 99.97%
   
   Monthly Savings (assuming 20 articles/month):
   Previous: 20 √ó $200 = $4,000
   Current: 20 √ó $0.05 = $1
   Monthly Savings: $3,999
   ```

2. **Volume Impact Calculation**
   ```
   Previous Volume: 5 articles/week = 20/month
   Current Volume: 50 articles/week = 200/month
   Volume Increase: 200/20 = 10x increase
   ```

**If Numbers Still Seem Wrong:**
1. **Check Calculation Assumptions**
   ```
   Verify these assumptions match your situation:
   - Previous manual cost: $200 per article
   - Current AI cost: ~$0.05 per article
   - Production time reduction: ~80%
   - Volume increase capability: ~10x
   ```

2. **Request Detailed Breakdown**
   ```
   Contact administrator for:
   - Detailed cost breakdown
   - Usage analytics report
   - Custom ROI calculation based on your specific costs
   ```
